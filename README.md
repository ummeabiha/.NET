What is .NET?
-------------

.NET is a free, open-source development platform for building various types of applications, including web, desktop, mobile, cloud, and more. It supports multiple programming languages like C#, F#, and Visual Basic and provides a rich set of libraries, tools, and frameworks for developers.

Installation
------------

To start developing with .NET, follow these steps:

1.  **Download .NET SDK**: Visit [dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and download the .NET SDK suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
    
2.  **Install .NET SDK**: Follow the installation instructions provided for your platform to install the .NET SDK on your machine.
    
3.  **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that .NET is installed correctly:
    
    ```bash
    dotnet --version
    ```
    
    You should see the installed .NET SDK version printed in the terminal.

Creating Your First Application
-------------------------------

Once you have .NET installed, you can create your first application:

1.  **Create a New Project**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Run the following command to create a new console application:
    
    ```bash
    dotnet new console -o MyFirstApp
    ```
    
2.  **Navigate to Project Directory**: Change to the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd MyFirstApp
    ```
    
3.  **Run the Application**: Use the following command to build and run the application:
    
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    
    You should see "Hello World!" printed in the terminal, indicating that your application is running successfully.
    
4.  **Explore Further**: Now that you have created and run your first .NET application, explore more features and capabilities of .NET by referring to the official documentation and tutorials.
